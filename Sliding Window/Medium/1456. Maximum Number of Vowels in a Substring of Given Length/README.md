## üß† Intuition

We need to find the **maximum number of vowels** in any substring of length `k`.  
This is a classic use-case for the **Sliding Window** technique since:
- The window size is fixed.
- We can efficiently move the window and update the count without recalculating from scratch.

## üîÄ Approach: Sliding Window

### ‚úÖ Steps:
1. Create a set of vowels for fast lookup.
2. Calculate the number of vowels in the first `k` characters (initial window).
3. Store this as the current max.
4. Slide the window one character at a time:
   - Add `+1` if the incoming character is a vowel.
   - Subtract `-1` if the outgoing character is a vowel.
   - Update the maximum if the current count is higher.
5. Return the maximum number of vowels seen in any window.
